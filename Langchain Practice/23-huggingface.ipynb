Markov chains: A type of generative model that generates sequences of symbols based on the probability of transitions between symbols.\\n2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): A type of generative model that processes sequential data by allowing connections between neurons to be recursive, creating a form of memory that helps the model understand the context of the data.\\n3.
